# Resetting

## Charge Pad

1. Place Ai Pin + Booster onto Charge Pad. The Charge Pad light should glow amber or green depending on the charge level.
2. Insert a paperclip into the reset hole next to the Charge Pad's USB port.
3. Push the paperclip in until you hear/feel a click. Continue holding this button until the Charge Pad light turns red. This represents a completed handshake with the Pin in the Pad.
4. Remove the paperclip and wait for the Pin to reboot. After 15-20 seconds of seeing the red light, you should see the rainbow Trust Light signifying a reboot.
